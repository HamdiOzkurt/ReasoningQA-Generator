        "answer": "Enabling 'opt-in' for error handling REST calls ensures that transactions are resubmitted in case of errors. When a call to the system fails, opting in triggers the process of re-submitting the transaction and allows for proper data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the document explain the difference between 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' regarding error handling?",
        "answer": "'Opt-in' implies that when an error occurs, you choose to re-submit the transaction for correction. On the other hand, 'opt-out' means not resubmitting the transaction even with errors. If errors occur, opting out will lead to a processing as per the status of 'opt-in' at the time of error."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key considerations before enabling this feature?",
